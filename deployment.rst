Deployment
==========

WSGI Server
-----------

There are many ways to deploy Alerta. It can be run as ``alertad``
during development or testing but when run in a production environment,
it should `always be deployed`_ as a WSGI application. See the list
of `real world`_ examples below for different ways to run Alerta as
a WSGI application.

.. note::
    When deploying with Apache mod_wsgi, be aware that by default
    Apache strips the Authentication header. This will cause you to
    receive "Missing authorization API Key or Bearer Token" errors.
    This can be fixed by setting ``WSGIPassAuthorization On`` in
    the configuration file for the site.

.. _always be deployed: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/deploying/
.. _WSGI: http://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html

.. _reverse proxy:

Web Proxy
---------

Running the Alerta API behind a web proxy can greatly simplify the
Web UI setup which means you can completely `avoid`_ the potential
for any cross-origin issues.

.. _avoid: http://oskarhane.com/avoid-cors-with-nginx-proxy_pass/

Also, if you run the API on an HTTPS/SSL endpoint then it can
reduce the possibility of `mixed content`_ errors when a web
application hosted on a HTTP endpoint tries to access resources
on an HTTPS endpoint.

.. _mixed content: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent/How_to_fix_website_with_mixed_content

**Example API configuration (extract)**

This example nginx server is configured to serve the web UI from
the root ``/`` path and reverse-proxy API requests to ``/api`` to
the WSGI application running on port 8080::

    server {

            listen 80 default_server deferred;

            access_log /dev/stdout main;

            location /api/ {
                    proxy_pass http://backend/;
                    proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            }

            location / {
                    root /app;
            }
    }

    upstream backend {
            server localhost:8080 fail_timeout=0;
    }

The server configuration file :file:`alertad.conf` for this setup
would need to set ``BASE_URL``::

    BASE_URL = '/api'

Additionally add the ``USE_PROXYFIX`` setting to fix relative links in HTTP
responses if the web proxy is used for SSL termination::

    USE_PROXYFIX = True  # use if proxy is terminating HTTPS traffic

And the web UI configuration file :file:`config.json` would need
the ``endpoint`` setting to match that::

    {"endpoint": "/api"}

.. _static website:

Static Website
--------------

The Alerta web UI is just a directory of static assets that can be
served from any location. An easy and cheap way to serve the web UI
is from an `Amazon S3 bucket`_ as a static website.

.. note:: Serving the Alerta web UI from a static web hosting site
          **will not work** unless that domain is listed in the
          ``CORS_ORIGINS`` Alerta API server configuration settings.

.. _Amazon S3 bucket: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html

.. _auth_ssl:

Authentication & SSL
--------------------

Alerta supports several authentication mechanisms for both the API
and the web UI and some key features of the web UI, like
watching alerts, are only available if
authentication is enabled.

The API can be secured using :ref:`API keys` and the web UI can
be secured using :ref:`basic_auth` or an provider from either 
:ref:`GitHub <github_oauth2>`, :ref:`GitLab <gitlab_oauth2>`, 
:ref:`Google <google oauth2>`, :ref:`Keycloak <keycloak oauth2>` 
or :ref:`SAML 2.0 <saml2_auth>`.

If you plan to make the web UI accessible from a public URL it is
strongly advised to :ref:`enforce authentication <Authentication>`
and use HTTPS/SSL connections to the Alerta API to protect private
alert data.

.. _auth_cv:

Authorisation & Customer Views
------------------------------

To restrict access to certain features use roles
and :ref:`customer views <customer views>`.

.. _scalability:

Scalability
-----------

Alerta can scale horizontally, in the same way any other web
application scales horizontally -- a load balancer handles the
HTTP requests and distributes those requests between all available
application servers.

.. _scale horizontally: https://blog.openshift.com/best-practices-for-horizontal-application-scaling/

.. note:: If using multiple API servers ensure the same ``SECRET_KEY``
          is used across all servers otherwise there will be problems
          with web UI user logins.

.. _high availability:

High Availability
-----------------

To achieve high system availability the Alerta API should be
deployed to scale out :ref:`horizontally <scalability>` and
the database should be deployed as a `replica set`_, if using
mongoDB, or configure `replication`_, if using Postgres.

.. _replica set: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/replica-set-high-availability/
.. _replication: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/high-availability.html

.. _housekeeping:

House Keeping
-------------

.. deprecated:: 5.0
    The :file:`housekeepingAlerts.js` script that was used for
    housekeeping is deprecated. Use the following instead.

There are some jobs that should be run periodically to keep the
Alerta console clutter free. To timeout *expired* alerts and
delete old *closed* alerts you need to trigger housekeeping.

This can be done with the ``alerta`` command-line tool::

    $ alerta housekeeping

This was not supported by earlier versions of the command-line tool
and cURL has to be used to access ``/management/housekeeping``.

The API key needs an admin scope if AUTH_REQUIRED is set to True.

It is suggested that you run housekeeping at regular intervals via
``cron``. Every minute or two is a suitable interval.

By default, the housekeeping job will remove any alerts that have been
expired or closed for 2 hours and any info messages that
are 12 hours old. In some cases, these retention periods may be too
long or too short for your needs.

Bear in mind that Alerta is intended to reflect the here and now, so
long deletion thresholds should be avoided. Where you do need to depart
from the defaults, you can specify like this::

    $ alerta housekeeping --expired 2 --info 12

.. _stale heartbeats:

:ref:`Heartbeats <heartbeats>` can be sent from any source to
ensure that a system is 'alive'. To generate alerts for stale
heartbeats the ``alerta`` command-line tool can be used::

    $ alerta heartbeats --alert

Again, this should be run at regular intervals via ``cron`` or
some other scheduler.

.. _metrics:

Management & Metrics
--------------------

There are two management endpoints that provide internal application
metrics.

The management endpoint :file:`/management/status` can be used to keep
track of realtime statistics on the performance of the Alerta API
like alert counts and average processing time. For convenience,
these statistics can be viewed in the *About* page of the Alerta
web UI or using the ``alerta`` command-line tool
:ref:`status <cli_status>` command.

The same metrics are also exposed at :file:`/management/metrics` in
the `exposition format`_ required by Prometheus so that it can be monitored
by Prometheus and other monitoring tools that implement the OpenMetrics_
standard.

.. _exposition format: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/
.. _OpenMetrics: https://openmetrics.io/

Web UI Analytics
----------------

Google analytics can be used to track usage of the Alerta web UI
console. Just create a new tracking code with the `Google analytics`_
console and add it to the :file:`alertad.conf` API configuration
file::

    GOOGLE_TRACKING_ID = 'UA-NNNNNN-N'

.. _Google analytics: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/
