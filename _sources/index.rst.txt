Alerta monitoring system
========================

The alerta monitoring system is a tool used to consolidate and de-duplicate
alerts from multiple sources for quick 'at-a-glance' visualisation. With
just one system you can monitor alerts from many other monitoring tools
on a single screen.

Alerta combines a JSON API :ref:`server <server>` for receiving, processing and
rendering alerts with a simple, yet effective :ref:`webui` and :ref:`command-line
tool <cli>`. There are numerous :ref:`integrations <integrations>` with popular_
monitoring_ tools_ and it is easy to add your own using the :ref:`API <api>`
directly, the :ref:`Python SDK <development>` or the same command-line tool to
:ref:`send alerts <cli_send>`. Access to the API and command-line tool can be
restricted using :ref:`API keys <api_keys>` and to the web console using
:ref:`Basic Auth <basic auth>` or :ref:`OAuth2 <oauth2>` providers Google,
GitHub and GitLab.

Demo Sites
----------

There is a public web console available for demonstration and testing:

- https://try.alerta.io (Google OAuth)

The web console is powered by a public API which can be used as a sandbox
for integration testing:

- https://alerta-api.fly.dev

The "API Explorer" can be used to query for and send alerts to the
public API server:

- https://explorer.alerta.io

The ``alerta`` command-line tool can also be used to generate alerts.
The required API key is ``demo-key``.
