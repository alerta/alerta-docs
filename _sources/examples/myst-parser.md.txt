`myst-parser` is a Markdown parser (`.md` files) that allows you to
combine all the power of Markdown with all the potential of
Sphinx. All at once!


```{note}
This whole page is written in Markdown (see [Show Source](https://sphinx-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_sources/myst-parser.md.txt)).

As you can see, Sphinx extensions keep working without changes (e.g. `sphinx-prompt` and `sphinx-copybutton`)
