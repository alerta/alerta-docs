Alerta monitoring system
========================

The alerta monitoring system is a tool used to consolidate and de-duplicate alerts from multiple sources for quick 'at-a-glance' visualisation. With just one system you can monitor alerts from many other monitoring tools on a single screen.

Alerta combines a JSON API :ref:`server <server>` for receiving, processing and
rendering alerts with a simple, yet effective :ref:`webui` and :ref:`command-line
tool <cli>`. There are numerous :ref:`integrations <integrations>` with popular_
monitoring_ tools_ and it is easy to add your own using the :ref:`API <api>`
directly, the :ref:`Python SDK <development>` or the same command-line tool to
:ref:`send alerts <cli_send>`. Access to the API and command-line tool can be
restricted using :ref:`API keys <api_keys>` and to the web console using
:ref:`Basic Auth <basic auth>` or :ref:`OAuth2 <oauth2>` providers Google,
GitHub and GitLab.

Demo Sites
----------

There are two demonstration and testing sites -- one for Google OAuth and one for GitHub OAuth:

-  http://try.alerta.io (Google OAuth)
-  https://alerta.herokuapp.com (GitHub OAuth over SSL)

And two API servers, configured to support Google and GitHub OAuth2:

-  http://api.alerta.io
-  https://alerta-api.herokuapp.com (SSL)

The API Explorer website can be used to query for, and send alerts to, the http://api.alerta.io API server. The command-line tool ``alerta`` can also be used to generate alerts. The required API key is ``demo-key``.
